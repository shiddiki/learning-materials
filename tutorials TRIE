    final goal is to get the value which xor with y value is the maximum xor value.
traversing the whole set to find the desired value will give time limit. the query range is huge. So, need to make a datastructure which may lead us to the maximum value.

now, in order to get maximum xor value, we can be greedy. As we know what bits do we need to get the maximum value.

suppose, we need to find a number which will give maximum value after xoring with 3(11). lets think of a 4bit number. The maximum number for this case can be,
1100(12). this will give max 1111 number after xor operation. We will use this knowledge here.


Solution:

    consider everything in 32bit number.
insert them in a trie. As there is erasing operation in the problem, we need a counter in each node to keep track of the number of subtree of the node.
Now, for the maximum number finding...
Consider the operand x in 32bit too, i.e. if it is 3(00000000000000000000000000000011); our desired number is (11111111111111111111111111111100)

we will choose our desired edge from each node of the trie. If it is not possible then we will go the other edge.
If you came to a node, then their will be at least an edge to go to, as all numbers are 32 bit.

Thats it, go to the final node, the path is the bit sequence of your desired value. xoring with x is the answer.

    Solution:
    
    Simply insert each allowable(good) substrings to trie. Number of nodes of the trie is the answer.
    This may give TLE.
    
    Optimization:
    let our strings is: aabababa
    let [0,4]characters are ok to be part of good string. 
    add : a,ab,aab,aaba,aabab. This strings r ok to be in trie, but trie traversing takes total 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 iterations.
          Though the have the same path, as each one is the prefix of the later one.
        
    Adding a, then a,b,a,b this only takes 5, but have the same effect on the trie. This is the optimization.
    
    Finally you can use dfs to count the nodes or any other way. After implementing the discussed optimization, still traversing the whole trie will not give tle.
